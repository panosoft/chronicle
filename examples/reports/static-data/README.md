# Static Report

This Report Module exports a basic Definition object that provides a static set of data to be used each time the Report is run.

This Report is pretty close to "as simple as it gets".

# Installation

To install and run this report, run the following in Terminal:

```sh
npm install
npm test
```

After running the above commands, the report pdf should open in a new window of your systems preferred pdf viewer. If it does not open automatically, the pdf can be found within the [`test/`](test/) directory after running `npm test`.

# Description

This Report Module exports a basic Definition object ([`lib/index.js`](lib/index.js)). This Definition contains four properties that define the Report: data, template, helpers, and partials. Lets walk through each of them:

- `data` - In this instance, the data property is an object literal containing static data. Each time the Report is run, this same data will be provided as the templates context.

- `helpers` - This object defines a single helper `help` that simply returns the supplied `value` argument.

- `partials` - This object defines a single partial `part` that returns a simple partial template.

- `template` - This string defines a simple template that makes use of the `data`, `helpers`, and `partials` supplied above.

The test script for this Report Module ([`test/index.js`](test/index.js)) runs the Report by supplying Chronicle Press with a direct reference to the Report Definition object itself (i.e. not a path to the module entry or to the bundled module file).

The HTML generated by the Press is then passed to PrinceXML for visual rendering and finally the HTML and PDF are saved to the local filesystem in the [`test`](test/) directory.
